          Prospect Park YMCA was the first gym that I got a membership at, and I've been going to this gym for a while. The gym has a great supportive community, and many other people around the same age as me. I go to the gym at least 5 days a week, most of the time by myself and sometimes with a freind.
          The gyms never terribly crowded so I don't have to wait for equipment like most of my friends that go to other gyms. This gym membership also grants access to the swimming pool, which I would go to often in the summer as a source of cardio.
          The gym also has yoga rooms, empty room for calisthenics, a court, a track, sandbags, and saunas.
          The membership also comes with a few annual guest pass so I could bring a few people into the gym as well.
