          Bill de Blasio’s Gym
        </div>
        <br>
A couple of minutes' walk from where I live, plopped somewhere in Park Slope, is a sports and recreation center like no other. You see, Park Slope isn't really the definition of bustling New York City crowded with people; it's more of a chill area for the locals. Situated 2 avenues from the busiest part of a not-so-packed neighborhood, it stuck out like a sore thumb. Crammed in between rows and rows of brick houses and a CVS, it was the only building of its type. Not just because the design of the building's exterior was 100 years behind the design of its surroundings, or that this was former Mayor Bill de Blasio’s preferred workout facility, but mainly because of its contrast to the mostly quiet neighborhood. The contrast between the not-so-lively streets and one of the most animated buildings might be missed by visitors on their first trip here, but is definitely noticed by the locals as something exceptional. After all, our former mayor is willing to take a trip from the Upper East Side just to come here to work out.
<br> <br>
The Prospect Park YMCA is not just a workout facility part of some larger companies; it is a gathering place for people of all backgrounds. It's not a place people go to just for its convenience because it's a few streets from where they live, but people go there for the delightful atmosphere. The atmosphere is created by real, everyday New Yorkers, coming from different neighborhoods all over the city. They are not the TikTok influencers or the news' depiction of New Yorkers as successful and self-oriented people who have an enormous drive to be better than everyone else. They aren't people that always have a packed schedule, aren't the richest, or the most successful. The real New Yorkers are people who are supportive and accepting of each other; they are people who know how to create suitable environments for all, and they are the reason the city is so diverse.
<br> <br>
The first time I ever went to Prospect Park YMCA, I swore I was at the wrong place. It looked nothing like a gym, but more like a building a few decades or centuries later than its time that would make more sense to be a museum. I had no idea where to go or how to navigate this gigantic building as I had just signed up, so I asked the front desk for directions to the swimming pool. I expected a point of the finger without a word being said, but I was met by a friendly staff member who told me to follow him. He then proceeded to take me on a tour of the whole YMCA, which was quite a walk, but the staff was willing to go out of their way to help me, so I went along. The staff member of the YMCA reminded me of the willingness of most New Yorkers to help others in need. Real New Yorkers stand by each other, and they don't mind the inconvenience that comes with supporting each other.
<br> <br>
At the Prospect Park YMCA, there is a place for everyone. People with different goals can all find a way to achieve them there. For instance, the swimming pools are a more professional environment for people who rigorously train, swimming back and forth with little to no interaction. On the other hand, the yoga room is for people who aim to decompress after the stress of their day. Similarly, the basketball court is for people who want to have a good time playing with their friends and unwind. The weight room is for competitive people to get together and uplift each other through their encouragement. Finally, the main gym is for all of the above people. It's a place for teenagers to hang out and hoard equipment; a place for training and improving; a place to destress and focus on the moment and improve mental wellness. The reason for all of these different departments was to ensure that everyone has what they need to accomplish their goals. New York also follows this trend of ensuring everyone fits in, as there are so many different places with different atmospheres for different people.
<br> <br>
The diversity of the Prospect Park YMCA would not have been possible without the vast variety of departments to pull everyone in, but most importantly, it would not have been possible without the New Yorkers themselves. When you walk into the YMCA, there are members and staff of every race, every ethnicity, every age, every gender, and people of different physical capabilities. You see this all throughout New York City as well. The vast majority of neighborhoods are widely diverse, and this is possible because of the pull that New York has on people, due to its ability to suit everyone, and most importantly, because of the tolerance and acceptance of New Yorkers towards each other. Prospect Park YMCA is the perfect resemblance to New York, and after all, it is Bill de Blasio approved.
